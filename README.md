In December 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46357169) cuts to legal aid had created "deserts" of provision across England and Wales.

Our analysis showed up to a million people lived in areas with no legal aid provision for housing, with a further 15 million in areas with one provider.

We analysed Ministry of Justice and Legal Aid Agency data since 2011-12 and found:

- Around a million fewer claims for legal aid were being processed each year.
- More than 1,000 fewer legal aid providers were paid for civil legal aid work than in 2011-12.
- Four legal aid providers for welfare cover Wales and the South West while 41 covered London and the South East.
- Almost half of all community care legal aid providers were based in London.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
