In December 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46357169) cuts to legal aid had created "deserts" of provision across England and Wales.

Our analysis showed up to a million people lived in areas with no legal aid provision for housing, with a further 15 million in areas with one provider.

We analysed Ministry of Justice and Legal Aid Agency data since 2011-12 and found:

- Around a million fewer claims for legal aid were being processed each year.
- More than 1,000 fewer legal aid providers were paid for civil legal aid work than in 2011-12.
- Four legal aid providers for welfare cover Wales and the South West while 41 covered London and the South East.
- Almost half of all community care legal aid providers were based in London.
